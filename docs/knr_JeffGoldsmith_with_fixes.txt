# This is K&R for perl. From Jeff Goldsmith.
# Bug Fixes by JGM 2005 and 2022
# Version: 2022-10-10 :
#           the site: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi
#           which hosted the code for many years is no longer available.
# Fixed a bug in the SuitQuality code for 7 card suits missing QJ.
# Fixed bug in the distribution code re discounting first doubleton.
# Fixed bug? in DK_CCCC code for richness; 0.325 becomes 0.375 (but maybe it should be .3125)
# Added quotes from the orginal Bridge World Article.
# including how to calculate support points; material never before seen on the Net.

# see the =BridgeWorld pod at the end of the code.
#
# Usage:
#        Reads from STDIN.
#        Suits should be in order Spades Hearts Diamonds Clubs separated by SPACES
#        Suits may contain either upper or lower case AKQJT, 10, digits 2-9 , upper or lower case x and minus signs for voids
#        The cards in the suits should be in descending order ie. QJ9876 NOT Q9876J or 2345KA
#         (usually it will not matter but there are a couple of corner cases where it does.)
#
#
print "Enter Hand in suit order spades hearts diamonds clubs; space separated  (^D to exit)\n";

The text which follows that is between <quote> ... </quote> is taken from the orginal BW article.
1. It identifies a bug in Jeff Goldsmith's original code re SuitQuality calculation for 7 card suits when
   missing Q, or J, or both.
2. It documents for the first time anywhere on the net, how the CCCC count values shortness once a fit has been found.
1. <quote>
     A 7 card suit would count 1 point extra (before multiplication by .7 for length) if _EITHER_ minor honor were missing.
     an 8 card suit, _UP TO_ 2 extra points for missing honors and an even longer suit, _UP TO_ 3 extra.
</quote>
2. When discussing this example hand,
         AJTxxx KT9x xx x,
originally valued as "just under 13" (actually 12.95 -- JGM)
<quote>
For later in the auction, in responding and rebidding, distributional hands like the example above
may greatly increase or decrease in value. The 3 points in distribution for that singleton and doubleton, 3 non-losers,
will be subtracted by the computer on a totally misfitting auction; and the distribution count may be as much as
doubled when the auction reveals a good fit. When supporting partner's suit with three or more trumps,
the computer adds an extra 50% to the short suit count if sure of an eight-card fit, and adds an extra 100%
when sure of a better fit. When it is partner who has supported, the extra credit is 25% for an assured eight-card fit,
50% for nine, 100% for huge fits.
Responder to that minimum one-spade opening gives a limit raise to three spades. The computer now
values opener's hand as close to 16, and bids on to game. Quite right too!
</quote>

JGM Comments:
1. Assuming the LR shows 4 card support, there is a 10 fit, so the 2 points for the stiff club become 4 (no pts for 1st dblton) and the hand
is now worth 14.95. I don't see 16 unless the 1st doubleton was counted (in error?) as 1 and is now worth 2 so a total of 15.95 pts. 
Regardless facing a LR (8 losers) a hand with 6.5 losers would usually bid game. 


2. Regarding supporting hands:
It sounds like when there is an 8 fit, (50% increase), the computer would give a hand with two doubletons, an extra half point,
(2nd doubleton now worth 1.5) and a hand with a stiff would get an extra point (stiff now worth 3 points).
When there is a 9+ fit (100% increase) a stiff would be worth 4 points and a second doubleton would be worth two.
If there were more than one stiff (a 6511 or 7411 hand say) then BOTH stiffs would be upgraded to 4 points.

The text refers to '8 fit' and '9 fit', not 3 trumps and 4 trumps. It is unclear how the KnR algorithm would treat
a supporting hand in a 4=4 fit. Would the stiff only increase in value from 2 to 3 or would it go from 2 to 4?
Presumably the non-supporting hand would still add 25% to its shortness points for the 8 fit.
