title " Checking how to nest ternary tests ; Compare brute force with Intermediate Vars "
# Last Edit 2024-10-26  
# In C and Perl you can nest the ternary almost indefinitely as in
# Answ =  ( cond1 ) ? Var1 :
#         ( cond2 ) ? Var2 :
#         ....
#         ( condn ) ? Varn : DefaultVar
# In Dealer there was an error in the precedence spec for the ?: operator. Fixed in DealerV2
# # Answ = ( cond1 ) ? Var1 :
#          ( cond2 ) ? Var2 : Default
# If cond1 is false it always used to produce Default as the value of Answ Fixed now.
# However you CAN do some Nesting.
# To find the maximum of 4 Values you can do: (Note this returns the value, but not the name of the longest suit)
ls =(  ( spades(west) >= hearts(west) ? spades(west) : hearts(west) ) >=    // if The len of longest Major >=
       ( (diamond(west) >= clubs(west))  ? diamond(west) : clubs(west)) ) ? //    The len of the longest Minor
       ( spades(west) >= hearts(west) ? spades(west) : hearts(west) ) :       // set ls to the len of longest Major
       ( (diamond(west) >= clubs(west) ) ? diamond(west) : clubs(west) )      // else set ls to len of longest Minor

# To find the minimum of 4 Values you can do: (Note this returns the value, but not the name of the shortest suit)
ss = (  ( spades(west) <= hearts(west) ? spades(west) : hearts(west) ) <=    // if The len of shortes Major <=
       ( (diamond(west) <= clubs(west))  ? diamond(west) : clubs(west)) ) ? //    The len of the shortest Minor
       ( spades(west) <= hearts(west) ? spades(west) : hearts(west) ) :       // set ss to the len of shortest Major
       ( (diamond(west) <= clubs(west) ) ? diamond(west) : clubs(west) )      // else set ss to len of shortest Minor

# But it might be more clear to have intermediate variables

       ( (diamond(west) >= clubs(west))  ? diamond(west) : clubs(west)) ) ?

       ( (diamond(west) >= clubs(west) ) ? diamond(west) : clubs(west) )

MLD =( (  clubs(west) ) >=  // if diamonds is the longest suit, then MLD is the value of the next longest suit.
       ( (spades(west)  >= hearts(west)) ? spades(west)  : hearts(west))) ?
       ( clubs(west)  ) :
       ( (spades(west)  >= hearts(west)) ? spades(west)  : hearts(west))

MLC =( (  diamond(west) ) >=  // if clubs is the longest suit, then MLC is the value of the next longest suit.
       ( (spades(west)  >= hearts(west)) ? spades(west)  : hearts(west))) ?
       ( diamonds(west)  ) :
       ( (spades(west)  >= hearts(west)) ? spades(west)  : hearts(west))

# Now we figure out which of MLS, MLH, MLD, or MLC to use.
L2S =  (spades(west)  == LS ) ? MLS : 0      // if spades is the longest suit, then L2S is the next longest else L2S is 0

# We now find the Maximum of the 4 values L2S, L2H, L2D, L2C -- using temporary variables
