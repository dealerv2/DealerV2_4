# 2023/03/19 Slight Mods by JGM to use dealerv2, bash, seeds in the Descr.* files 
# 2023/03/20 Renamed all the Dealer input files from Descr.xxxxx to xxxxx.dli 
#            the Output files become xxxxx.dlo and the Refer xxxxx.ref
#            and the ones with scripting from HOW2.xxxxx to xxxxx.dls
# 2023/12/15 Added ability to test script (aka dls) files. Changed names of targets.
#
# Makefile to process all *.dli files with dealer and write the output to *.dlo
# 'make test' executes the test, 'make refer' copies the current .dlo files to .ref 
# 'make clean' cleans up, 
# Edit the line DEALER to call upon the test version or the production version.
#

DEALER = ../Prod/dealerv2    # new version of dealerv2 to be tested
#DEALER = ../Debug/dealdbg    # new debug version of dealerv2 to be tested
#DEALER = ./dealerv2         # new version to be tested copied to the Regression directory aka ../Prod/dealerv2
#DEALER = dealerv2           # reference version currently in production
