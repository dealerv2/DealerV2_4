This is the directory Regression/Notes 
The .dli files in the Regression directory all have a seed cmd in them; the seed number is typically a prime.
The primes can be got from the ~/Programming/Perl5/Testing/primes_list.pl or ./Code/primes_list.pl


To find out the seeds type the cmd: (which will sort in increasing seed order)
grep seed *.dli | sort  -k 2.1 -g
as of 2025/06/30 the highest seed in use is:  #67 prime is = 337


There is also a script that will check the .out  files in the Regression/Output/ directory vs the .ref files in the Refer sub-directory.

As of 2024 there is a Makefile, and bash and Perl scripts that automate much of the process. See the README file in the Regression directory.
