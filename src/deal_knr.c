/*

This code has been submitted by Danil Suits <DSuits@silknet.com>, Mar 10, 1999.

It implements the cccc() and quality() functions.  Both quality and cccc
use the algorithms described in _The Bridge World_, October 1982, with the
single exception that the values are multiplied by 100 (so that we can use
integers for them).  Thus, a minimum opening bid is about 1200, rather
than 12.00 as expressed in the text.

In the original algorithm, everything was done with fractions.  Floating
point rounding being what it is, I've decided to implement this instead as
integer math, until the last step.

As it happens, it is currently more convenient to use integers for the
return value from these functions as well So for the moment, Rescale is
basically a no-op.
*
* JGM Update 2022/02/15: The user now has the option of specifying the desired
* CCCC and Suit quality values using 'dotnums' aka numbers with Decimal pts
* for example 12.75 or 6.5 or 0.5; as in cccc(north) >= 13.25
* But the dotnums are converted to ints by x100 so this code works exactly
* the same as before. The user is spared the inconvenience of x100
* and the Dealer Input File looks 'nicer'.
*
* JGM 2022/10/18 fixed several bugs in the original code; Qx, Qxx, AQ KQ stiff Q, first doubleton, and ded for 4333.
* JGM 2023/01/22 Allowed 1st dblton to count for +1 if there is also another shortness. 6-4-2-1 counts 3 pts for shortness.  -- Removed from code.
* JGM 2025-04-15 Always discount the first doubleton, as that is more 'standard'. Never return a negative value, which per Pavlicek is possible.
